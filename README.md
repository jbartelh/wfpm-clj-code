# 'Why Functional Programming Matters' in clojure

['Why Functional Programming Matters' by John Hughes](https://www.google.com)

After a quick time reading the paper, i opened up a clojure REPL and tried out the things described in the paper.
The dynamic of the REPL makes it really easy to play around and try out a lot of things
--- What happens if i change this, could this also work? --- 
This helped me a lot to understand the described concepts and ideas.
